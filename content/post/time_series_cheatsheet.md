This article aims to provide some pre-fabricated functions for time series analysis. After a dedication in Time Series field for past few months,  I found it is good for getting some structual knowledge recorded.



Through extensive projects and refinement, I have crafted a collection of functions that aim to streamline the process of analyzing temporal patterns, identifying trends, and extracting meaningful insights from time series datasets. 



In real work, I use these function to deliver fast results, although the basic notion can be easily forget sometimes : )
